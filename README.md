Credo is a framework written in TypeScript for building **SSI Agents and DIDComm services** that aims to be **compliant and interoperable** with the standards defined in the [Aries RFCs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs).

> **Note**
> The Aries Framework JavaScript project has recently been rebranded to "Credo" and was moved from the Hyperledger Foundation to the Open Wallet Foundation.
> We are currently in the process of changing the name of the project to Credo, and updating all the documentation and links to reflect this change.
> You may encounter some broken links, or references to the old name, but we are working hard to fix this. Once the new name has been decided
> we will update this README and all the documentation to reflect this change.
> You can follow this discussion for updates about the name: https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/agent-framework-javascript/discussions/1668

## Getting Started

Documentation on how to get started with Credo can be found at https://credo.js.org/

### Demo

To get to know the Credo flow, we built a demo to walk through it yourself together with agents Alice and Faber.

### Divergence from Aries RFCs

Although Credo tries to follow the standards as described in the Aries RFCs as much as possible, some features in Credo slightly diverge from the written spec. Below is an overview of the features that diverge from the spec, their impact and the reasons for diverging.

| Feature                                                                                                                                                        | Impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Reason                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Support for `imageUrl` attribute in connection invitation and connection request                                                                               | Properties that are not recognized should be ignored, meaning this shouldn't limit interoperability between agents. As the image url is self-attested it could give a false sense of trust. Better, credential based, method for visually identifying an entity are not present yet.                                                                                                                       | Even though not documented, almost all agents support this feature. Not including this feature means Credo is lacking in features in comparison to other implementations. |
| Revocation Notification v1 uses a different `thread_id` format ( `indy::<revocation_registry_id>::<credential_revocation_id>`) than specified in the Aries RFC | Any agents adhering to the [revocation notification v1 RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0183-revocation-notification) will not be interoperable with Credo. However, revocation notification is considered an optional portion of revocation, therefore this will not break core revocation behavior. Ideally agents should use and implement revocation notification v2. | Actual implementations (ACA-Py) of revocation notification v1 so far have implemented this different format, so this format change was made to remain interoperable.      |
