Credo is a framework written in TypeScript for building **SSI Agents and DIDComm services** that aims to be **compliant and interoperable** with the standards defined in the [Aries RFCs](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs).

> **Note**
> The Aries Framework JavaScript project has recently been rebranded to "Credo" and was moved from the Hyperledger Foundation to the Open Wallet Foundation.
> We are currently in the process of changing the name of the project to Credo, and updating all the documentation and links to reflect this change.
> You may encounter some broken links, or references to the old name, but we are working hard to fix this. Once the new name has been decided
> we will update this README and all the documentation to reflect this change.
> You can follow this discussion for updates about the name: https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/agent-framework-javascript/discussions/1668
