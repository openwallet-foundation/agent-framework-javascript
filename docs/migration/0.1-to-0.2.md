# Migrating from AFJ 0.1.0 to 0.2.x

## Breaking Storage Changes

The 0.2.0 release is heavy on breaking changes to the storage format. This is not what we intend to do with every release. But as there's not that many people yet using the framework in production, and there were a lot of changes needed to keep the API straightforward, we decided to bundle a lot of breaking changes in this one release.

Below all breaking storage changes are explained in as much detail as possible. The upgrade assistant provides all tools to migrate without a hassle, but it is important to know what has changed.

### Credential Metadata

The credential record had a custom `metadata` property in pre-0.1.0 storage that contained the `requestMetadata`, `schemaId` and `credentialDefinition` properties. Later a generic metadata API was added that only allows objects to be stored. Therefore the properties were moved into a different structure.

The following pre-0.1.0 structure:

```json
{
  "requestMetadata": <value of requestMetadata>,
  "schemaId": "<value of schemaId>",
  "credentialDefinitionId": "<value of credential definition id>"
}
```

Will be transformed into the following 0.2.0 structure:

```json
{
  "_internal/indyRequest": <value of requestMetadata>,
  "_internal/indyCredential": {
    "schemaId": "<value of schemaId>",
    "credentialDefinitionId": "<value of credential definition id>"
  }
}
```

Accessing the `credentialDefinitionId` and `schemaId` properties will now be done by retrieving the `CredentialMetadataKeys.IndyCredential` metadata key.

```ts
const indyCredential = credentialRecord.metadata.get(CredentialMetadataKeys.IndyCredential)

// both properties are optional
indyCredential?.credentialDefinitionId
indyCredential?.schemaId
```

### Mediation Record Role

The role in the mediation record was always being set to `MediationRole.Mediator` for both mediators and recipients. This didn't cause any issues, but would return the wrong role for recipients.

In 0.2 a check is added to make sure the role of a mediation record matches with actions (e.g. a recipient can't grant mediation), which means it will throw an error if the role is not set correctly.

Because it's not always possible detect whether the role should actually be mediator or recipient, a number of configuration options are provided on how the role should be updated:

- `allMediator`: The role is set to `MediationRole.Mediator` for both mediators and recipients
- `allRecipient`: The role is set to `MediationRole.Recipient` for both mediators and recipients
- `recipientIfEndpoint`: The role is set to `MediationRole.Recipient` if their is an `endpoint` configured on the record. The endpoint is not set when running as a mediator. There is one case where this could be problematic when the role should be recipient, if the mediation grant hasn't actually occurred (meaning the endpoint is not set). This is probably the best approach
  otherwise it is set to `MediationRole.Mediator`
- `doNotChange`: The role is not changed

Most agents only act as either the role of mediator or recipient, in which case the `allMediator` or `allRecipient` configuration is the most appropriate. If your agent acts as both a recipient and mediator, the `recipientIfEndpoint` configuration is the most appropriate. The `doNotChange` options is not recommended and can lead to errors if the role is not set correctly.
