# Setup Libindy for Android

1. Make sure you have added `indy-sdk-react-native` as a dependency to your project. If not please first see the [React Native Setup](../setup-react-native.md) guide.
2. Follow the Android installation steps from the RN Indy SDK docs [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk-react-native#android)
   - Step 4 of the RN Indy SDK tutorial requires you to download and add binaries to the project. You can also copy the `jniLibs` from [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native/tree/main/android/app/src/main)
3. You now have libindy installed for Android. You can continue with the [React Native Setup](./../setup-react-native.md)

An example Android project making use of Aries Framework JavaScript in React Native is [Aries Mobile Agent React Native](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-mobile-agent-react-native).
