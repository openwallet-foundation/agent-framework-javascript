# Setup React Native

## Prerequisites

To start using Aries Framework JavaScript in React Native some platform specific dependencies are required.

1. Follow the [React Native Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) guide to set up your environment.
2. Add `@aries-framework/core`, `@aries-framework/react-native`, `react-native-fs`, and `react-native-get-random-values` to your project.

## Installing dependencies

```bash
yarn add @aries-framework/core @aries-framework/react-native react-native-fs react-native-get-random-values
```

Right now, as a patch that will later be changed, some platforms will have an "error" when installing the dependencies. This is because the BBS signatures library that we use is built for Linux x86 and MacOS x86 (and not Windows and MacOS arm). This means that it will show that it could not download the binary.
This is not an error, as the library that fails is `node-bbs-signaturs` and is an optional dependency for perfomance improvements. It will fallback to a, slower, wasm build.

3. Install [Libindy](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk) for iOS and Android:

   - [iOS](../docs/libindy/ios.md)
   - [Android](../docs/libindy/android.md)

4. If you're using React Native > 0.61.5, make sure you have Hermes enabled, as the app will crash on Android when opening a ledger pool. See the React Native [docs](https://reactnative.dev/docs/hermes) on Hermes on how to enable Hermes.

### Using decorators

If you intend to extend the core framework capabilities good change you will need to use decorators. In this case you need to enable support for decorators in both TypeScript and Babel.

1. Install `babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata` and `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`

```sh
yarn add babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata @babel/plugin-proposal-decorators
```

2. Add them to your babel config

```js
// babel.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ... other config ... //
  plugins: ['babel-plugin-transform-typescript-metadata', ['@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators', { legacy: true }]],
}
```

3. Enable decorators in your `tsconfig.json`

```jsonc
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ... other options ... //
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true
  }
}
```

## Agent Setup

Initializing the Agent also requires some React Native specific setup, mainly for the Indy SDK and File System. Below is a sample config, see the [README](../README.md#getting-started) for an overview of getting started guides. If you want to jump right in, check the [Getting Started: Agent](./getting-started/0-agent.md) guide.

```ts
import { Agent } from 'aries-framework/core'
import { agentDependencies } from '@aries-framework/react-native'

// This creates an agent with all the specified configuration data
const agent = new Agent(
  {
    label: 'my-agent',
    walletConfig: {
      id: 'walletId',
      key: 'testkey0000000000000000000000000',
    },
  },
  agentDependencies
)

// Make sure to initialize the agent before using it.
try {
  await agent.initialize()
  console.log('Initialized agent!')
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error)
}
```

## Using BBS Signatures

When using AFJ inside the React Native environment, temporarily, a dependency for creating keys, sigining and verifying
with bbs keys must be swapped. Inside your package.json the following must be added:

#### yarn

```diff
+   "resolutions": {
+     "@mattrglobal/bbs-signatures": "@animo-id/react-native-bbs-signatures@0.1.0",
+   },
    "dependencies": {
      ...
+     "@animo-id/react-native-bbs-signatures": "0.1.0",
    }
```

#### npm

```diff
+   "overrides": {
+     "@mattrglobal/bbs-signatures": "@animo-id/react-native-bbs-signatures@0.1.0",
+   },
    "dependencies": {
      ...
+     "@animo-id/react-native-bbs-signatures": "0.1.0",
    }
```

The resolution field says that any instance of `@mattrglobal/bbs-signatures` in any child dependency must be swapped
with `react-native-bbs-signatures`.

The added dependency is required for autolinking and should be the same as the one used in the resolution.

[React Native Bbs Signature](https://github.com/animo/react-native-bbs-signatures) has some quirks with setting it up correctly. If any errors occur while using this library, please refer to their README for the installation guide.
