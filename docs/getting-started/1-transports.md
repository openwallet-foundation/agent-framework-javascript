# Transports

An agent needs an inbound and outbound transporter. At this current time, the outbound transporter is already built-in and can be used. The inbound transporter is a tad bit more complicated and has to be added manually.

## Outbound Transport

Outbound transports allow you to send messages to other agents. Currently, only a single outbound transport can be used. See [Issue 268: Add support for multiple transports](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-framework-javascript/issues/268) for progress on supporting multiple outbound transports.

```ts
import { HttpOutboundTransporter, WsOutboundTransporter Agent } from '@aries-framework/core'

const agent = new Agent({
  /* config */
})

// Use HTTP as outbound transporter
const httpOutboundTransporter = new HttpOutboundTransporter()
agent.setOutboundTransporter(httpOutboundTransporter)

// Or use WebSocket instead
const wsOutboundTransporter = new WsOutboundTransporter()
agent.setOutboundTransporter(wsOutboundTransporter)
```
